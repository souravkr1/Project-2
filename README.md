Exploratory Data Analysis - Project 2
=========================

This is my repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis". Currently there are 12 files for the Course Project 2: 6 png pictures and 6 scripts to generate each.

To run this script you need to to the following:
* Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R, plot5.R, plot6.R) to some directory;
* Download the data from here:http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html;
* Extract the data into ./Data subdirectory;
* Run the scripts
